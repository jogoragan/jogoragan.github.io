During this time, your blood sugar levels drop, and your glycogen stores are depleted. To perform a high-intensity workout like HIIT, your body needs carbohydrates for energy. Eating before a morning HIIT workout will help you replenish your glycogen stores and provide your body with the fuel it needs to perform at its best.</p><h2 id="section2">How long before a morning HIIT workout should you eat?</h2><p>The timing of your pre-workout meal is crucial. Eating too close to your workout can cause digestive issues, while eating too early may leave you feeling hungry during your workout. Ideally, you should eat a balanced meal containing carbs, protein, and healthy fats 1-2 hours before your morning HIIT workout.</p><h2 id="section3">What to eat before a morning HIIT workout?</h2><p>Now that you know why and when to eat before your morning HIIT workout, let's discuss what to eat.
