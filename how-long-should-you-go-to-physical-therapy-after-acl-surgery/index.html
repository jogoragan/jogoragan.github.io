Typically, the duration of physical therapy after ACL surgery lasts for six to twelve months. During this period, the patient will undergo a series of exercises and treatments to regain their strength, mobility, and flexibility. The first few weeks after surgery, the physical therapist will focus on reducing the swelling, managing the pain, and gradually increasing the range of motion of the knee.

As the patient progresses, the physical therapist will introduce more challenging exercises and activities such as cycling, swimming, and weight-bearing exercises. The patient will also be taught how to perform functional movements like squatting, jumping, and landing to prepare them for their daily activities or sports. \u003ca id=\u0022section3\u0022\u003e\u003c\/a\u003e\u003ch2\u003ePros and Cons of Physical Therapy After ACL Surgery\u003c\/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePros:\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSpeeds up the recovery process\u003c\/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eReduces pain and swelling\u003c\/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eImproves strength, mobility, and flexibility\u003c\/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrevents future injuries\u003c\/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelps to regain confidence and independence\u003c\/li\u003e\u003c\/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCons:\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eCan be expensive if not covered by insurance\u003c\/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRequires a lot of time and effort\u003c\/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCan be physically and emotionally challenging\u003c\/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMay not guarantee a full recovery\u003c\/li\u003e\u003c\/ul\u003e\u003ca id=\u0022section4\u0022\u003e\u003c\/a\u003e\u003ch2\u003eFAQs about Physical Therapy After ACL Surgery\u003c\/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Is physical therapy necessary after ACL surgery?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\/\u003e A: Yes, physical therapy is necessary after ACL surgery to ensure a full and proper recovery. \u003cstrong\u003eQ: How long does physical therapy last after ACL surgery?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\/\u003e A: Physical therapy after ACL surgery typically lasts for six to twelve months. \u003cstrong\u003eQ: How often do I need to attend physical therapy sessions?\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\/\u003e A: The frequency of physical therapy sessions varies depending on the patient\u0027s condition and the recommendation of the physical therapist.
