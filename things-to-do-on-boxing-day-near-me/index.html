Whether you're looking for indoor or outdoor activities, there are plenty of things to do on Boxing Day. In this guide, we'll explore some of the best things to do on Boxing Day near you, so let's get started.</p><h2>What is Boxing Day?</h2><p>Boxing Day is a public holiday that falls on December 26th, the day after Christmas. The origins of Boxing Day are unclear, but it's believed to have started in the UK during the Middle Ages. It's called Boxing Day because it was a day when servants and tradespeople would receive a "Christmas box" from their employers or customers. Today, Boxing Day is celebrated in many countries around the world, with different traditions and customs.</p><h2>Things to Do on Boxing Day Near Me</h2><h3>1. Go for a Walk</h3><p>One of the best things to do on Boxing Day is to go for a walk. Whether you live in the city or the countryside, there are plenty of beautiful walks to enjoy. You could go for a walk in a local park or nature reserve, or explore new areas and countryside. Walking is a great way to burn off some of those Christmas calories and get some fresh air.</p><h3>2. Visit a Museum or Gallery</h3><p>If you're looking for indoor activities, then visiting a museum or gallery is a great option. Many museums and galleries are open on Boxing Day, and they often have special exhibitions or events. Check out what's on near you and plan a visit with family or friends.</p><h3>3. Have a Movie Marathon</h3><p>Another great indoor activity is to have a movie marathon. Curl up on the sofa with some popcorn and watch your favourite films. You could also have a themed movie marathon, such as Christmas films, action films, or comedies. This is a great way to relax and spend time with loved ones.</p><h3>4. Shop the Sales</h3><p>Boxing Day is famous for its sales, and many people head to the shops to grab a bargain. If you're a fan of shopping, then this is the perfect day to hit the sales. Just be prepared for crowds and queues!</p><h3>5. Play Board Games</h3><p>Board games are a classic way to spend time with family and friends, and they're perfect for Boxing Day. You could play traditional games like Monopoly and Cluedo, or try out some new games. Board games are a great way to have fun and create memories.</p><h3>6. Visit a Theme Park</h3><p>If you're looking for a fun day out, then why not visit a theme park? Many theme parks are open on Boxing Day, and they often have special events and activities. This is a great option if you're looking for something exciting and adventurous.</p><h3>7. Have a Picnic</h3><p>If the weather is good, then why not have a picnic? You could pack up some sandwiches and snacks and head to a local park or beach. This is a great way to enjoy the outdoors and have a relaxing day.</p><h3>8. Go Ice Skating</h3><p>Ice skating is a fun activity that's perfect for the winter season. Many towns and cities have ice rinks that are open on Boxing Day. This is a great option if you're looking for something active and enjoyable.</p><h3>9. Visit a Zoo or Aquarium</h3><p>If you're an animal lover, then visiting a zoo or aquarium is a great option. Many zoos and aquariums are open on Boxing Day, and they often have special events and activities. This is a great way to see some amazing animals and learn more about them.</p><h3>10.
