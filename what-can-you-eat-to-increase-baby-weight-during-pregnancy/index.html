Some good options include:</p><ul><li>Almonds</li><li>Walnuts</li><li>Cashews</li><li>Peanuts</li><li>Sunflower seeds</li><li>Pumpkin seeds</li></ul><p>You can eat nuts and seeds as a snack or sprinkle them on top of salads or oatmeal for an extra nutrient boost.</p><h2 id="water">Water</h2><p>Staying hydrated is important during pregnancy to help your body function properly and ensure your baby is getting enough fluids.
